Conference App for ProgressNEXT.  License is ASL2

NextWeb is the Node.js server-side code
ProgressNEXT-hybrid is the (currently hybrid, i.e. Apache Cordova) mobile app.

The Rollbase Application is still missing.  There is an ongoing effort to redo the mobile app as a [NativeScript](http://nativescript.org) application but that is on hold until later in the summer.

A proper architectural description of the application is TBD.  A set of pictures of the event, including a simple architectural diagram, is in this [Flickr Album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42919418@N03/albums/72157663713877206).
